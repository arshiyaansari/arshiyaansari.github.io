my first introductory blog post begins with a reflection back on the journey that brought me here. in 2017, i made the biggest change of my life on my roommate’s twin-size mattress in the middle of the night. dropping all of my pre-medical courses to pursue a computer science degree was something i never envisioned doing when i stepped on my college campus in 2016 — yet there i was! it just seemed like the best decision; it was written in my stars. in the next three years, i was immersed in a world so vibrant and evolving, i had never felt more at home. through this blog, i hope to tell the story of my programming journey so it’ll help other people in tech find their footing. 

to actually introduce myself, i’m arshiya! i am currently a master’s of data science student at the university of virginia, with a graduation date in may 2021. i also just finished a double major in computer science and statistics as an undergraduate at the university of virginia, and in my past, i have interned at companies like CGI Federal, Capital One, and Apple. in my free time, i really enjoy playing guitar, cooking, and i recently picked up skateboarding! if you’re starting out in tech, or would just love to chat, please send me an email or a LinkedIn DM because i would love to connect.
