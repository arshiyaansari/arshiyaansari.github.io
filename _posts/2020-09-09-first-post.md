My first introductory blog post begins with a reflection back on the journey that brought me here. In 2017, I made the biggest change of my life on my roommate’s twin-size mattress in the middle of the night. Dropping all of my pre-medical courses to pursue a computer science degree was something I never envisioned doing when I stepped on my college campus in 2016 — yet there I was! It just seemed like the best decision; it was written in my stars. In the next three years, I was immersed in a world so vibrant and evolving, I had never felt more at home. Through this blog, I hope to tell the story of my programming journey so it’ll help other people in tech find their footing. 

To actually introduce myself, I’m Arshiya! I am currently a Master’s of Data Science student at the University of Virginia, with a graduation date in May 2021. I also just finished a double major in computer science and statistics as an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, and in my past, I have interned at companies like CGI Federal, Capital One, and Apple. In my free time, I really enjoy playing guitar, cooking, and I recently picked up skateboarding! If you’re starting out in tech, or would just love to chat, please send me an email or a LinkedIn DM because I would love to connect.
