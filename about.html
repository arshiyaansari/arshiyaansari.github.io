## About Me

masters of data science candidate at the university of virginia. interested in exploring data through code; extracting a signal from the noise. i'm passionate about creating an interdisciplinary impact with machine learning and artificial intelligence in the fields of neuroscience and autonomous systems.

i am currently working on a capstone project to develop a specialized LSTM network that models after the scale-invariant patterns of the brain's time cells and quantify its effects on accuracy for EEG data. the goal is to improve the prediction accuracy of current BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) technology on EEG data by implementing neural features as artificial agents.
