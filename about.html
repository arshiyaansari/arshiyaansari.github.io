## About Me

Masters of Data Science student at the University of Virginia. Interested in exploring data through code; extracting a signal from the noise. I'm passionate about creating an interdisciplinary impact with machine learning and artificial intelligence in the fields of neuroscience and autonomous systems.

I am currently working on a capstone project to develop a specialized LSTM network that models after the scale-invariant patterns of the brain's time cells and quantify its effects on accuracy for EEG data. The goal is to improve the prediction accuracy of current BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) technology on EEG data by implementing neural features as artificial agents.
